#Walkthrough

This is one of my weak points. I like code injection directly on the stack, or
`ROP` based code injection, but I am generally not as comfortable when it comes
to network-based exploitation. However, that can be changed simply -- just study.

Apparently, this program listens on port 64000. So let's open a socket in Python
to talk with it.

```
>>> import socket
>>> s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM) #opening in stream mode
>>> s = s.connect(("127.0.0.1",64000))
>>> msg = s.recv(10000)
>>> #look at the number in the msg, I received
>>> num = 224036774
>>> s.send(num.to_bytes(4,'little'))
>>> s.recv(10000)
```

And this works immediately!
